## Notes

Getting the database to work alongside the recycler view was very hard for me. It took multiple coding attempts to get it to work and I learnt some best practices for using interfaces and setting up the project. Originally, i tried to code this using the main activity as the list starting screen, but I found it better to use nav graph and separate fragments to finish the project.
